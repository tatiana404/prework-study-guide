## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- As many newcomers I came to Canada to start a new life here. In my home country I was working as QA Engineer but my skiils should be improved to find a job here - so this is my main motivation - to gain new knowledge for a dream job in Canada
- During my Prework task I used different tools I was not familiar with before so building this project definitely enlarged my knowledge.
- THis project helped me to build my own first simple web page - it definitely solved the problem of insufficient experience 
- With this project I learned how to build simple web page using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript


## Installation

First I had to build simple HTML file, then I used CSS for adding style and layout to the webpage. JC code helped my web page to look more proficient. Work with GIT gave me a knowledge how to work within a team to make a new project.

## Usage

This webpage shows basic information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and shows how I implemented it into my project
